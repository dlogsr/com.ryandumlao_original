        <h3>Background</h3>
     </hgroup>
     <p>A Bay Area native currently in Los Angeles, I have undertaken a variety of experiences throughout my life. From early 2000 web development, to electrical engineering research and work, and personal interests, I am a well-rounded and experienced professional.</p>
     <p>I hold an MS from UCLA and a BS from UCSD in Electrical Engineering, with emphasis on Solid State Electronics and Photonics. My interests include web technology, web design, nanotechnology, semiconductors, photonics, and the ever-growing tech industry, among many others. I also enjoy photography and compilation video editing. I have strived to maintain a diverse working experience, including radiation detection, FPGA programming, hardware integration and testing, space-grade optical engineering, corporate finance, and commercial supplier quality control. On the side, I have experience in web design and programming.
